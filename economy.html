	    <h1>Economy</h1>
	    <p>The main economic resource that the Pacific Maritime has is forestry. The wood that is chopped is distributed to the rest of Canada.&nbsp;Another important industry is fishing but because of overfishing, the number of fish in this has been decreased over the years.&nbsp;The coastal mountains have many resources such as gold, sulfur, copper, silicon, bismuth, silver and jade.Tourism is another important industry. With many of the amazing sights, landmarks, and attractions, the tourism industry is thriving. </p>

	          <p>The pacific coast has an abundance of forests which causes many logging companies to take advantage of them. Most of the wood from Canada was shipped from BC. As a result of over logging and deforestation, the area that the forests have been covering has been decreasing. </p>

      <h3>Mining </h3>
      <p>The coastal mountains are full of minerals. There are several minerals that are being mined such as coal, copper, gold, and lead. The minerals are then processed and exported to other places in Canada. When the metals are being refined, sometimes it involves burning coal. The coal would release carbon dioxide emissions. This would cause the surface to warm, increasing drought rates and crop failure. </p>

      <h3>Fishing </h3>
      <p>Coastal communities are very big on fishing as they are supplied with plentiful resources from the Pacific Ocean. However, it is not only the ocean that can provide the Pacific Maritime with fish. They have inlets, rivers, and lakes that are also habitats for countless species of fish. The </p>

      <h3>Farming </h3>
      <p>Because of the high amounts of rainfall, this ecozone has rich soil making it an ideal place to grow crops. In the Fraser valley grapes grow in profusion allowing for a major wine industry. However, extensive farming of these grapes can negatively affect the surrounding wildlife as many rely on the grapes as a source of food. </p>

      <h2>Tourism </h2>
      <p>The Pacific Maritime, although small, accounts for most of BC's economy. It has a GDP of 58.2 billion dollars per year. Major industries such as logging, fishing, farming, mining and tourism account for most of that money. Tourism has flourished in recent decades as more and more people come to visit the Pacific Maritime. Tourists marvel at the beauty of the Coast mountains and are amazed by the diverse group of animals. Tourists activities include whale watching tours, skiing down the coastal mountains, surfing, and helicopter tours of the area. Tourism in the Pacific Maritime has grown from a local business to a thriving billion-dollar industry. </p>
