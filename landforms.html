	          <h3>Majestic Mountains</h3>
	          <p>Most of the regions of the Pacific Maritime are occupied by the Coastal Mountains. They were formed when the North American and Pacific Plate collided in the Mesozoic era. The Coastal Mountains stretch across 1600 km of land from the Fraser Lowlands near Vancouver. Some mountains are even 4000 metres high with Mount Waddington being the highest at 4016 metres tall and the highest mountain in BC. As you can see from the picture the Coast Mountains are beautiful and are definitely a must see if you visit the Pacific Maritime. </p>

	          <h3>Water</h3>
	          <p>There are several major water bodies near the pacific maritime such as the Pacific Ocean and the Fraser River. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean in the world. It has marine life such as fish, turtles, whales, and seals which can all be found at the coast of the Pacific Maritime. The Pacific Ocean is the main reason for the maritime climate the Pacific maritime receives as it influences the rainfall and the temperature. The Fraser river is the longest river in British Columbia stretching 1370 km long and with a drainage basin of 233 100 km2. The source of the river is located near Mount Robson and ends near Vancouver. It has an abundance of wildlife and 80 percent of British Columbiaâ€™s economic production comes from the river. The river has many activities such as fishing, rafting and boat rides and the world famous Abbotsford International Airshow.</p>

      <h3>Soil</h3>
      <p>The soil in the Pacific Maritime is very rich and allowing for many different types of vegetation to be grown. The reason why the soil is rich is due to the excess rainfall that the side of the mountain facing toward the ocean is receiving. This causes minerals in the rain to leach in the soil. Another reason why the soil is rich is because of the abundance of humus found in the soil. There are decomposing trees that give nutrients to the soil. The leeward side of the mountain receives less rain and causes the soil to have less minerals and nutrients, resulting in less vegetation to growing there. In the areas with higher elevation, the soil is also less fertile and lacks the nutrients for vegetation. The rich soil makes it great for agriculture, with fruit plantations and and vineyards. In fact, the ecozone has a large wine industry and has many award winning wineries. </p>
